# BRENDANCREATES Backend

### About

This is the back-end for my website.
It is essentially a glorified email handler, but with the ability to expand functionality
as my site builds.

I would eventually like to build out multiple API endpoints for serving and receiving different info, such as serving coordinates to draw
polygons, or serving a blog.

### Tech

- Fiber
- Mailgun API
